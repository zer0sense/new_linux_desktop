# Using Ansible to Deploy and Update my Config

## Pre-Reqs
**You must have ansible installed**

If you aren't sure you can try ansible --version

The only way I am able to get this working is by using sudo and running a command before using ansible-pull.
---
If you are using a debian based distrobution with APT as the package manager you can use this

```
sudo apt update && ansible-pull -U https://github.com/zer0sense/ansible_desktop
```
If you are using an Arch Based distrobution with PACMAN you can use this.

```
sudo pacman -Sy && ansible-pull -U https://github.com/zer0sense/ansible_desktop
```

I am not able to get nerd-fonts to install through ansible, so you will have to run the install script manually.
	
```
~/git/nerd-fonts/install.sh
```

If you get a shada error when using checkhealth in neovim use the following
```
nvim - NORC
```
If you run this playbook on the same machine twice you will have to remove the .ohmyzsh folder in your home directory or else it will fail. This will halt the playbook from continuing.
